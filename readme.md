> Author: @alekssamos

It's still in development...

For now, you can only change your voice using buttons and only voice short messages.

It will soon be possible to voice large files without limits.

## How do I launch it?

Export `BOT_TOKEN`  environment variable and run the binary.
Compiled builds are available on the releases page.

## How build?

```bash
go build .
```
